What's this? Why you've found my technology reading list! 
I'm naturally curious about how things work and I do a lot of reading as a graduate student. This year I'd like to track and share some of my readings.
If you're curious about what is on my bookshelf, this is my personally curated list of interesting papers and books.
General themes around my reading list will continue to be around security, AI and software practices.

      </li>
    {% endfor %}
