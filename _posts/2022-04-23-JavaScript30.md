### âš¡ #JavaScript30: Back to Basics!

I'm going back to basics and tackling JavaScript with the [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge. I'm super excited to revisit and strengthen my existing JavaScript skills. I've written bits of Node and JavaScript on and off throughout the years and this time I'd like to sit down and do a proper deep dive into the foundational concepts of JavaScript.

Along with #JavaScript30, I'm reading [JavaScript for impatient programmers](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/) and will be writing posts about what I learned. I'm new to blogging and will take inspiration from [Seth Godin's](https://seths.blog/) blogging style, short and concise. I really look forward to building some fun projects in vanilla JavaScript and learning new things!
