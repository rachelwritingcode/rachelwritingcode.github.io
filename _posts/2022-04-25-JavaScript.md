## JavaScript for impatient programmers: Chapter 6! 

### Super introductory information but definitely necessary if I'm going back to basics. Here are my Seth Godin style short snippets of info. Wahoo! Let's go!🎊

### JavaScript
- JavaScript can execute in browser, server or any device that has a JavaScript engine.
- The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
    - V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
    - SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.

- JavaScript does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
- JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment .
- Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.
- JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of a user’s safety. 
- In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.

### On Engines
- Engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
- Converts (“compiles”) script to machine language.
- Machine code runs.

### Node.js is Important
- Write server-side software in JavaScript.
- Write software for the command line. 
- Node’s software registry, npm, a dominant way of installing tools (such as compilers and build tools) and libraries – even for client-side development.


### But I have a question...what's happening under the hood when JavaScript runs? 

## Stay tuned, I'm going to cover it in my next post...🎉
