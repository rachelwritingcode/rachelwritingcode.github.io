_Calling all Cyber Security Professionals! Let's Learn Some Python!_ 

Python is one of my favourite languages to teach and I think it's great for beginner programmers. I'm currently building out a new Python programming workshop geared for cyber security professionals and I'm collaborating with the awesome people from the [Cyber Aegis Community](https://cyber-aegis.ca/about.php). 

Years ago I taught Python with the PyLadies and Women Who Code Community, and used the Raspberry Pi to introduce beginners to the Python. For this upcoming workshop series, I'm excited to incorporate a new project focused activity. I won't reveal all the details yet but I will be teaching alongside another instructor and we will walk beginners from their first hello world to functions. We are still solidifying the curriculum but since this is for cyber security professionals, you can be certain there will be a few CTF flags to capture. 

When I last checked, Python ranked first on the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and this doesn't surprise me. It is a popular language found in all industries. I'm curious how our workshop participants will apply their Python skills. Some of my classmates from the cyber security field, have expressed that it is a useful skill to have, even in the cyber security domain. 

My professional experience using Python has been heavily focused on the data science libraries for building out data pipelines. I work in a domain where data transformation, cleaning and standardizing are common tasks. I have done these tasks in other languages such as Golang but found I much preferred Python, as it handles different data types easily. 

Once we are ready to open up workshop registration I will be sharing the information! Stay tuned for more!

Cheers!ðŸ‘‹
